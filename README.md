# UN Goal Timelines

[Google UN Data Commons Nav for API](https://datacommons.org/tools/statvar#s=dc%2Fs%2FUnitedNationsUn&d=dc%2Fd%2FUnitedNationsUn_SdgIndicatorsDatabase) - Widen your screen to explore root of 17 UN Goals.  
Display 21 "GOALS" in our left navigation by turning on "Dev Mode" under Settings in the upper right.

## Projects

TO DO: [County Timelines](/data-commons/docs/data/) and [Country & State Timelines](/data-pipeline/timelines/earthscape/datacommons.html#country=IN,CN,US) from Google Data Commons API


TO DO: Combine our [Earthscape Tabulator](../data-pipeline/timelines/training/naics/) with our [chartJS Google timeline display](/data-pipeline/timelines/earthscape/datacommons.html#country=IN,CN,US) by adding to [earthscape.js](/localsite/js/earthscape.js).

<!--[worldbank.org indicators](https://github.com/phiresky/world-development-indicators-sqlite/)-->

<!--
	TO DO: Display all 17 Global Goal indicator lines on one large 30-year timeline chart with projections.<br><br>
-->

TO DO: [Python with UN Goal topics Google Sheet](docs/data/) for larger timeline datasets to be used by [RealityStream](/RealityStream/).


Pre-saving .csv files using python in our CoLabs is easier to collaborate on than [Observable Data Loaders](https://observablehq.com/framework/loaders).

See our [Data Loader notes on Weather API](docs/air/) and [DuckDB Parquet display sample](/data-commons/dist/innovation/) 


## Making Updates

[Our Development Folders (docs)](docs/) and [Built Output (dist)](dist/)

After [creating your webroot](../../localsite/start/steps/) and pulling down [data-commons](https://github.com/modelearth/data-commons), edit pages and build your static site to update the local "dist" folder.

	cd data-commons
	yarn build	

Visit the following to view built: <http://localhost:8887/data-commons/dist> and source <http://localhost:8887/data-commons/docs>  
The "dist" folder is only deployed live by Loren to avoid file conflicts.

## UN Sustainable Development Goals</h2>

[UN Data Commons: SDG Data by Goal](https://unstats.un.org/UNSDWebsite/undatacommons/sdgs)
The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) data resides in the [Google Data Commons API](https://docs.datacommons.org/api/).

TO DO: Replace the above image with linked images and interactivity by finding a GitHub repo containing UN Goal marketing material, including icons and related images.<br><br>



## Install and Build Locally

This is an [Observable Framework](https://observablehq.com/framework) project. 
Run once daily when you start - updates dependencies defined in [package.json](package.json):
This is the same as running `yarn install`

	yarn

If you don't have yarn yet, install it with `npm install --global yarn`
You can check if you have yarn with `yarn --version`

**Build the data-commons project locally**
This pulls from APIs and outputs from "[docs](docs)" to static files in "[dist](dist)".
You won't be deploying changes to "dist" because numerous merge conflicts occur.
Contact Loren to build and deploy your changes to dist.

	yarn build

The following is an alternative to using `yarn build` with `yarn dev` 
You can use this to view the content of dist locally at:
[http://localhost:8887/data-commons/dist](http://localhost:8887/data-commons/dist)


This setup allows you to view multiple repos in one webroot.
If you haven't yet, start an http server in your webroot, external to the data-commons folder.

	cd ../ && python -m http.server 8887

If you haven't yet, pull down the [localsite repo](https://github.com/modelearth/localsite).
This provides navigation when you view src files in the "[docs](docs)" folder.

	git clone https://github.com/modelearth/localsite localsite &&
	cd data-commons

Then visit the following to view:
<http://localhost:8887/data-commons/dist>
<http://localhost:8887/data-commons/docs>

Turn on GitHub Pages for any repos you fork so we can preview changes at [youraccount].github.io.

## Project structure

In our project, folders for components and data reside in multiple "goal" folders.
Add the [localsite repo](https://github.com/modelearth/localsite/) external to the [data-commons repo](https://github.com/modelearth/data-commons/). Your [webroot setup](https://model.earth/localsite/start/steps/) with 2 folders:

```ini
localsite
data-commons
├─ README.md
├─ docs
│  ├─ space
│  │  ├─ components
│  │  │ 	└─ timeline.js     # an importable module
│  │  ├─ data
│  │  │ 	└─ events.json     # a static data file
│  │  └─ launches.csv.js       # a data loader
│  ├─ jobs
│  ├─ transit
│  ├─ innovation
│  ├─ education
│  ├─ economy
│  ├─ index.html               # a localsite page visible in docs
│  └─ index.md                 # a dist page
├─ dist
├─ observablehq.config.ts      # the project config file
├─ package.json
└─ .gitignore
```

**`docs`** - This is the “source root” — where your source files live. Pages go here. Each page is a Markdown file. Observable Framework uses [file-based routing](https://observablehq.com/framework/routing), which means that the name of the file controls where the page is served. You can create as many pages as you like. Use folders to organize your pages.

**`docs/index.md`** - This is the home page for your site. You can have as many additional pages as you’d like, but you should always have a home page, too.

**`docs/data`** - You can put [data loaders](https://observablehq.com/framework/loaders) or static data files anywhere in your source root, but we recommend putting them here.

**`docs/components`** - You can put shared [JavaScript modules](https://observablehq.com/framework/javascript/imports) anywhere in your source root, but we recommend putting them here. This helps you pull code out of Markdown files and into JavaScript modules, making it easier to reuse code across pages, write tests and run linters, and even share code with vanilla web applications.

**`observablehq.config.ts`** - This is the [project configuration](https://observablehq.com/framework/config) file, such as the pages and sections in the sidebar navigation, and the project’s title.
